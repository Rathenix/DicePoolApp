Star Wars: Edge of the Empire campaign dice calculator

This Star Wars: Edge of the Empire campaign dice calculator was created by Brian Miller for personal use, but please feel free to use it yourself. This is a working, but still in development application, so do not be surprised if there are latent issues. The layout was designed for quick use on a mobile phone to keep the game moving quickly during checks and combat so as not to take from the overall narrative of the game.

Download
------------------------
Because this app is designed to be browsed to on a mobile device, you don't really need to download it to use it. Just navigate to rathenix.github.io/DicePoolApp and use it. If you want to download it to make changes or host it elsewhere on your own, you are welcome to do so. It's just an html file, some css, and some js. Nothing to compile or setup, just drop the files in a directory somewhere and point a site at it. That's it.

Usage
------------------------
The up and down arrows add and remove dice from your dice pool. Dice of the same type are automatically grouped together for ease of counting. Click Roll Dice to roll all of the dice in your pool and view the results. The Success/Failure text tells you if you netted at least one success, and the number next to it is how many net successes or failures you rolled. If there is a triumph or a despair, it is already included in that total, but a note will appear next to it informing you how many of each you rolled. Likewise, the advantages and threats are totalled and the net is displayed next tot he label. Use the Reset Pool button to remove all dice and hide the results section.

Future Changes
------------------------
Below is a list of planned future changes. They are in no specifi order and can change frequently or without notice.
- Update up and down arrow images
- Update top section to have larger buttons
- Keep track of number of dice of each type in dice selection section
- Fix button shadow bug (move margin from results container to button container)
- Show die faces on results? (Maybe. Might be too cluttered)
- Redesign dice selection (?)
