Star Wars: Edge of the Empire campaign dice calculator

This Star Wars: Edge of the Empire campaign dice calculator was created by Brian Miller for personal use, but please feel free to use it yourself. This is a working, but still in development application, so do not be surprised if there are some latent issues or if the app stops working at some point. The layout was designed for quick use on a mobile phone while playing to keep the game moving during checks and combat so as not to take from the overall narrative of the game.

Download
------------------------
Because this app is designed to be browsed to on a mobile device, you don't really need to download it to use it. Just navigate to http://rathenix.github.io/DicePoolApp (case-sensitive) and use it from there. If you want to download it to make changes or host it elsewhere on your own, you are welcome to do so. It's just an html file, some css, and some js. Nothing to compile or setup; just drop the files in a directory somewhere and point a site at it or open the index.html file in your browser. That's it.

Usage
------------------------
The up and down arrows add and remove dice from your dice pool. Dice of the same type are automatically grouped together for ease of counting. Click Roll Dice to roll all of the dice in your pool and view the results. The Success/Failure text tells you if you netted at least one success, and the number next to it is how many net successes or failures you rolled. If there is a triumph or a despair, it is already included in that total, but a note will appear next to it informing you how many of each you rolled. Likewise, the advantages and threats are totalled and the net is displayed next to the label. Use the Reset Pool button to remove all dice from the pool and hide the results section.

Future Changes
------------------------
Below is a list of planned future changes. They are in no specific order and can change frequently or without notice. This list is basically just for me to keep track of the things I want to do or any bugs that are pointed out to me that I want to fix.
- Update up and down arrow images (css?)
- Update top section to have larger buttons
- Fix text placement on reset button on mobile
- Fix overall size for iPhone 4
- Keep track of number of dice of each type in dice selection section
- Fix button shadow bug (move margin from results container to button container)
- Show die faces on results? (Maybe. Might be too cluttered)
- Redesign dice selection (?)
- Add force dice? (Not really sure how useful this is currently)
- Add d100
- Roll history? (suggestion by /u/PonySaint)
